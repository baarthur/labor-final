For this, we use a geocoded employer-employee panel data 2006-2014, exogenously determined grid and diﬀerent geographical distance bands. We deal with the spatial sorting and endogeneity in the wage-agglomeration economies relationship with controls for observable and unobservable individual and establishment characteristics and instrumental variables based on the exogenous expansion of higher education in Brazil in period 1991-2004. Our main results indicate that distance seems to be still more important in developing countries context. Adding 1,000 college-educated workers up to 1 km from the individual’s workplace would increase the wages of workers on average by 6.78 percent. On the other hand, if the same number of workers are added to the 1-5 km or 5-10 km range, the wages of workers would increase, on average, by 1.95 and 1.27 percent, respectively. This evidence is robust to diﬀerent speciﬁcations (e.g., including worker-plant or worker-city matches) and shows that the speed of decay of agglomeration economies is higher in Brazil than observed in developed countries.","author":[{"family":"Almeida","given":"Edilberto T"},{"family":"Neto","given":"Raul M Silveira"},{"family":"Rocha","given":"Roberta M"}],"citation-key":"almeida2022","event-place":"Salvador, BA","event-title":"XX Enaber","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"pt-BR","publisher-place":"Salvador, BA","source":"Zotero","title":"The spatial extent of human capital spillovers in a transition country: Evidence from Brazil","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"bertaud2018","abstract":"\"This book emerges from a 55-year career in urban planning, and is illustrated by the author's real-world experience. Without understanding how markets work, urban planners are likely to design infrastructure and regulations that will adversely impact the functioning of cities. By contrast, urban economists review decisions and outcomes after the fact, often publishing their conclusions in specialized journals that fail to influence decision making. This book is a call for qualitative urban planners and quantitative urban economists to come together. Specifically, the book calls for urban economists to take a larger role in the process of operational urban planning. For example, land prices decrease the further away one gets from a city center. When land prices are high, households and firms consume less land; that is, they live in smaller homes and work in smaller offices. Population density then increases because the city is still a desirable place to be, and you can fit more people in smaller spaces. While urban planning often tries to limit densities, it is almost impossible to do so when the price of land is high. Without understanding the factors that lead to high prices, urban planners cannot effectively plan cities, and rents skyrocket and commutes take longer. Cities generate a large amount of data, often recorded in urban departments, but remain unused; urban economists can make use of this new data and provide answers to critical questions in urban economic development. The book does not introduce new concepts of urban economics but uses existing theories to try to improve the practice of urban planning. It looks at such topics as infrastructure, housing affordability, transportation, labor markets, regulation, mobility, and pollution\"--","author":[{"family":"Bertaud","given":"Alain"}],"call-number":"HT321 .B478 2018","citation-key":"bertaud2018","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","ISBN":"978-0-262-03876-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"number-of-pages":"413","publisher":"MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Order without design: how markets shape cities","title-short":"Order without design","type":"book"},

When the effects of treatment cross over borders, classical difference-in-differences estimation produces biased estimates for the average treatment effect. In this paper, I introduce a potential outcomes framework to model spillover effects and decompose the estimate's bias in two parts: (1) the control group no longer identifies the counterfactual trend because their outcomes are affected by treatment and (2) changes in treated units' outcomes reflect the effect of their own treatment status and the effect from the treatment status of \"close\" units. I propose estimation strategies that can remove both sources of bias and semi-parametrically estimate the spillover effects themselves including in settings with staggered treatment timing.

We show that treatment effect on the treated-type parameters can be identified under a generalized parallel trends assumption that is similar to the binary treatment setup. However, interpreting differences in these parameters across different values of the treatment can be particularly challenging due to treatment effect heterogeneity. We discuss alternative, typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular two-way fixed-effect specifications can be hard to interpret, even when there are only two time periods. We introduce alternative estimation strategies that do not suffer from these drawbacks.

  {"id":"campos2016","abstract":"We estimate the intra-urban wage premium and its attenuation with distance from a balanced panel of workers in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region in the period 2002–2014, dispersed in a fine grid of 1km x 1km cells. We do not determine exogenously central business centers (CBD) or sub-centers (SBD), but estimate the wage premium for each cell and for two layers of surrounding cells. Based on the wage premium estimated in these three layers, we were able to estimate the attenuation effect. This way of estimating the wage premium and its attenuation in space is novel to the literature. We estimate POLS and Fixed Effects specifications to illustrate how the sorting of workers and firms is powerful in biasing the estimated coefficients. Since sorting might be present even after the introduction of fixed effects of worker, firm, cell, sector-cell and matches firm-worker-cell, we run a 2SLS-IV model. We instrumentalize employment in the cells by the additional constructed area for business and housing purposes, lagged by 7 years. Even after controlling for those time-constant effects, our instrumental variable estimation provides evidence of an intra-urban wage premium and its non-isotropic agglomeration effects. The estimated premium is larger by multiples of the POLS or Fixed Effects estimations. The magnitude of the effects is economically relevant: the introduction of 100,000 additional workers in the inner cell produces a 1.78% increase in wages in that cell. The effects on the surrounding cells are negative and much larger than in other forms of estimation that do not correct for endogeneity. The heterogeneity analysis revealed that educated workers benefit the most from the increased interaction possibilities given by concentration and they are less affected when located in the surrounding cells.","author":[{"family":"Campos","given":"Rodger B A"},{"family":"Azzoni","given":"Carlos R"}],"citation-key":"campos2016","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"42","source":"Zotero","title":"Estimating the Intra-Urban Wage Premium","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"ceder2021","abstract":"The purpose of this work is to review urban transportation likely to be offered in the future. Trip-making behaviour has already changed considerably as lifestyles change and they will continue to change in the future. This work reflects and places emphasis on profound thinking about the possibilities, rather than predicting them. Thoughts about possibilities for the future draw upon imagination, perceived and justified feasibility, and lessons gained from the past. This work attempts to capture the possibilities, logistics and travel modes of future urban transportation. A visionary, feasibility-related approach grounded in a realist perspective is proposed, only conceptually, to explore plausible visions for the future. In addition, this work shows the inefficiency of using private cars (PCs) and argues that in the development of autonomous and electric vehicles, PCs cannot provide a solution competitive with the potential that urban transportation systems have for the future. Hence, the solutions for the future must be based on public transport (PT) modes of travel, regardless of whether they are metro, bus, light rail, tram, ridesharing services, an ordinary taxi, personal rapid transit, or any other PT-based future mode. The key principal of operation for the mobility of a smart city will be the ability to optimize the connectivity of movement in order to approach a seamless move, while endowing the phrase door-to-door travel with new meaning. Finally, it would be remiss not to mention the unforeseeable implications of the Covid-19 pandemic for future mobility, more controllable by automation of non-privately owned vehicle, and with the prospect of people demonstrating a greater inclination towards changing their habits, behaviour, and thinking paradigms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Ceder","given":"Avishai (Avi)"}],"citation-key":"ceder2021","container-title":"International Journal of Urban Sciences","DOI":"10.1080/12265934.2020.1799846","ISSN":"1226-5934","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,2]]},"page":"455-479","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Urban mobility and public transport: future perspectives and review","title-short":"Urban mobility and public transport","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/12265934.2020.1799846","volume":"25"},

It has been argued that the potential agglomeration benefits are large; if so, understanding them better would be useful in making funding decisions about public transport improvements. We reviewed theoretical and empirical literature on agglomeration as well as a small number of articles on transportation's role in agglomeration. The theoretical literature is useful in understanding possible avenues by which transportation improvements might affect agglomeration, although there is little discussion of public transport specifically. Relevant empirical studies tend to focus on metropolitan regions and use a generalized measure of transportation cost. But public transport impacts on agglomeration are likely to be different from road investment impacts. We identified several ways of conducting research building on this literature that would help evaluate the agglomeration impacts of public transport proposals: tracing the links between transport, agglomeration, and productivity; better motivating research using theories of agglomeration mechanisms; taking scale and redistribution into account; exploring the functional form of agglomeration economies; accounting for endogeneity in model structure; and considering development context.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Chatman","given":"Daniel   G."},{"family":"Noland","given":"Robert   B."}],"citation-key":"chatman2011","container-title":"Transport Reviews","DOI":"10.1080/01441647.2011.587908","ISSN":"0144-1647","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,11,1]]},"page":"725-742","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Do Public Transport Improvements Increase Agglomeration Economies?

  {"id":"credit2018","abstract":"This article examines the impact of Phoenix’s light rail system, which opened in 2008, on new firm formation in specific industries. Individual business data from 1990–2014 are used in a quasi-experimental adjusted-interrupted time series (AITS) regression to compare the impact of the transit system’s construction on new business starts in ‘treatment’ and ‘control’ areas before and after the opening of the line. Findings show that the transit adjacency is worth an 88% increase in knowledge sector new starts, a 40% increase in service sector new starts and a 28% increase in retail new starts at the time the system opened, when compared with automobile-accessible control areas. However, the light rail also appears to suffer from a ‘novelty factor’– after the initial increase in new establishment activity in adjacent block groups, the effect diminishes at the rate of 8%, 6% and 7% per year, respectively. The results also provide insight into the spatial extent of light rail impacts to new business formation, with areas 1 mile from stations observing 21% fewer retail new business starts and 12% fewer knowledge sector new starts than areas within a quarter of a mile of stations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Credit","given":"Kevin"}],"citation-key":"credit2018","container-title":"Urban Studies","container-title-short":"Urban Studies","DOI":"10.1177/0042098017724119","ISSN":"0042-0980, 1360-063X","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"language":"en","page":"2838-2862","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Transit-oriented economic development: The impact of light rail on new business starts in the Phoenix, AZ Region, USA","title-short":"Transit-oriented economic development","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0042098017724119","volume":"55"},

The results based on this model, which captures how land allocation responds to changes in temperature and precipitation, are introduced as elasticities in the CGE model to offset the demand curve for land among 13 different land uses in 27 regions of Brazil.

It has been argued that polycentricity is just an intermediate stage between monocentricity and a more unstructured, chaotic and amorphous location model, scatteration. For the case of the polycentric Barcelona, the aims of this study are to test: whether its employment is moving from polycentricity to scatteration; and, whether its employment location model is increasingly random and unstructured. The results show that, in spite of the decentralisation and deconcentration processes, employment concentrated in centres still represents a significant percentage of total employment and new sub-centres have emerged in the periphery. What is more, the results also show an increasing influence of employment sub-centres on employment location and density conditions.

Our results show that the subsidy, equaling 32% of the regular fare, significantly and substantially increases the total number of monthly public transport trips. However, the results suggest that the size of the subsidy’s effect on ridership has decreased over time, while also evidencing a more pronounced effect among economically active individuals compared to inactive ones. Overall, our results suggest that public transport subsidies for low-income individuals can be an effective way for increasing public transport use among this population segment, which may translate into improved well-being because of improved access to local labor markets and recreational activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Guzman","given":"Luis A."},{"family":"Hessel","given":"Philipp"}],"citation-key":"guzman2022","container-title":"Transport Policy","container-title-short":"Transport Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.tranpol.2022.07.016","ISSN":"0967070X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9]]},"language":"en","page":"215-224","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The effects of public transport subsidies for lower-income users on public transport use: A quasi-experimental study","title-short":"The effects of public transport subsidies for lower-income users on public transport use","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0967070X22002037","volume":"126"},

In this paper, we first explore such phenomenon from the perspective of the distance of the residence to the geographic concentration of jobs, and locational disadvantages of the urban form itself. Such unequal conditions in the labor market present a great challenge for the spatial sustainability of the multiple equilibria achieved simultaneously at the labor and the housing markets. We estimate the main aspects that influence wage differentials among individuals, focusing on the role of accessibility on labor market outcomes. We suggest the inclusion of geographical characteristics as instruments to deal with endogeneity problems that arise in the estimation of urban price models. Our strategy is based on the inclusion of a specific geographic/historic variable as instrument, namely the river shore access to the first school built by the Jesuits in São Paulo, the city’s founding location. Geography acted as a determinant of the location of the transportation infrastructure in the region, so that the road and rail networks in the city present a strong spatial correlation with pre-urban “waterways”.

The increase of PT ridership is constrained by many aspects; among them, travel time and the built environment are considered the most critical factors in the choice of travel mode. We propose a data fusion framework including real-time traffic data, transit data, and travel demand estimated using Twitter data to compare the travel time by car and PT in four cities (São Paulo, Brazil; Stockholm, Sweden; Sydney, Australia; and Amsterdam, the Netherlands) at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We use real-world data to make realistic estimates of travel time by car and by PT and compare their performance by time of day and by travel distance across cities. Our results suggest that using PT takes on average 1.4–2.6 times longer than driving a car. The share of area where travel time favours PT over car use is very small: 0.62% (0.65%), 0.44% (0.48%), 1.10% (1.22%) and 1.16% (1.19%) for the daily average (and during peak hours) for São Paulo, Sydney, Stockholm, and Amsterdam, respectively. The travel time disparity, as quantified by the travel time ratio\n              \n                \n                  $$R$$\n                  \n                    R\n                  \n                \n              \n              (PT travel time divided by the car travel time), varies widely during an average weekday, by location and time of day. A systematic comparison between these two modes shows that the average travel time disparity is surprisingly similar across cities:\n              \n                \n                  $$R < 1$$\n                  \n                    R\n                    <\n                    1\n                  \n                \n              \n              for travel distances less than 3 km, then increases rapidly but quickly stabilises at around 2. This study contributes to providing a more realistic performance evaluation that helps future studies further explore what city characteristics as well as urban and transport policies make public transport more attractive, and to create a more sustainable future for cities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Liao","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Gil","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Rafael H.

In Nairobi, Kenya, workers and jobs are not well connected: On average, residents can access fewer than 10 percent of existing jobs by foot within an hour. Even using a minibus, they can reach only about a quarter of jobs. This study further demonstrates that poorer households and residents living in informal settlements are even more limited. Living closer to job opportunities is costly in Nairobi. Not only are housing quality and living conditions frequently better in such areas, but the high value placed on job accessibility also makes these areas more expensive.

  {"id":"paez2012","abstract":"Accessibility is a concept of continuing relevance in transportation research. A number of different measures of accessibility, deﬁned as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative deﬁned) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Páez","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Scott","given":"Darren M."},{"family":"Morency","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"paez2012","container-title":"Journal of Transport Geography","container-title-short":"Journal of Transport Geography","DOI":"10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2012.03.016","ISSN":"09666923","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,11]]},"language":"en","page":"141-153","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Measuring accessibility: positive and normative implementations of various accessibility indicators","title-short":"Measuring accessibility","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0966692312000798","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"peraltaquiros2019","abstract":"This paper presents an analysis of transit accessibility to employment for 11 African cities. The use of identical methodologies and similar data sets allows for the creation of the first benchmark to compare accessibility across urban areas in Africa through different metrics and visuals. The study shows how the spatial pattern of land use and transport systems perform in connecting people to employment opportunities in these various settings. This first comparable benchmark is achieved by overcoming two significant data hurdles that are common in many developing country cities and in Africa in particular: (i) the scarcity of information on the distribution of employment and (ii) the lack of information on transit routes and travel times. These data gaps are filled through a novel methodology to estimate the distribution of employment in urban areas (Employment Opportunity Areas) as well as a comprehensive mapping of informal transit networks. The analysis developed here can be replicated in different cities in the future. The computation of these baseline accessibility studies also opens up the possibility to assess the impacts of future transport investments and/or land use changes, through the use of counterfactual scenarios, which could assist decision makers in these cities. Finally, this analysis can serve as a demonstration that the computation of accessibility metrics is achievable, including in data scarce environments, and should be considered as a progress indicator for Sustainable Development Goal 11.2, which focuses on safe and affordable transport for all, including public transport.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Peralta Quiros","given":"Tatiana"},{"family":"Kerzhner","given":"Tamara"},{"family":"Avner","given":"Paolo"}],"citation-key":"peraltaquiros2019","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,8]]},"language":"en","number":"3434753","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"Social Science Research Network","title":"Exploring Accessibility to Employment Opportunities in African Cities: A First Benchmark","title-short":"Exploring Accessibility to Employment Opportunities in African Cities","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3434753"},

  {"id":"pereira2019","abstract":"Um dos principais objetivos das políticas de transporte urbano é facilitar o acesso das pessoas a oportunidades de emprego, serviços de saúde e educação, atividades culturais e de lazer. No entanto, os estudos e as políticas de mobilidade urbana no Brasil costumam dar ênfase aos desafios de reduzir congestionamentos e o tempo que as pessoas gastam no trânsito, ao passo que dedicam pouca atenção ao tema da acessibilidade urbana. Este estudo apresenta os primeiros resultados do Projeto Acesso a Oportunidades, e faz um retrato das desigualdades de acesso a oportunidades nas maiores cidades brasileiras no ano de 2019, com estimativas de acesso a empregos, serviços de saúde e educação. Nesta edição, o estudo inclui estimativas de acessibilidade por modos de transporte ativo (a pé e de bicicleta) para as vinte maiores cidades do país, e por transporte público para sete grandes cidades (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Recife, Fortaleza, Porto Alegre e Curitiba). O projeto combina dados de registros administrativos, pesquisas amostrais, dados de imagens de satélite e de mapeamento colaborativo, para se calcular os níveis de acessibilidade em alta resolução espacial, e desagregados por grupos socioeconômicos segundo nível de renda e cor/raça. Os resultados revelam dois padrões gerais. Em todas as vinte cidades estudadas, a concentração de atividades nas áreas urbanas centrais aliada à performance/conectividade das redes de transporte leva a áreas de alta acessibilidade próximas ao centro das cidades, em contraste com regiões de periferia marcadas por desertos de oportunidades. Ainda, os resultados apontam que a população branca e de alta renda tem em média mais acesso a oportunidades de trabalho, saúde e educação do que a população negra e pobre em todas as cidades estudadas, independentemente do meio de transporte considerado. Os resultados e bases de dados do Projeto Acesso a Oportunidades são disponíveis publicamente, criando rico material que pode ser utilizado para guiar o planejamento e avaliação de políticas públicas que promovam cidades sustentáveis e inclusivas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Pereira","given":"Rafael Henrique Moraes"},{"family":"Braga","given":"Carlos Kauê Vieira"},{"family":"Serra","given":"Bernardo"},{"family":"Nadalin","given":"Vanessa Gapriotti"}],"citation-key":"pereira2019","container-title":"http://www.ipea.gov.br","container-title-short":"Texto para Discussão (TD) 2535 : Desigualdades socioespaciais de acesso a oportunidades nas cidades brasileiras – 2019","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"pt-BR","note":"Accepted: 2020-01-13T15:08:23Z","publisher":"Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada (Ipea)","source":"repositorio.ipea.gov.br","title":"Desigualdades socioespaciais de acesso a oportunidades nas cidades brasileiras – 2019","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://repositorio.ipea.gov.br/handle/11058/9586"},

  {"id":"scholl2018","abstract":"Despite the growing interest in and proliferation of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems around the world, their causal impacts on labor market outcomes remain unexplored. Reduced travel times for those who live near BRT stations or near feeder lines, may increase access to a wider array of job opportunities, potentially leading to increased rates of employment, access to higher quality (or formal) jobs, and increased labor hours and earnings. This paper assesses the effects of the Metropolitano, the BRT system in Lima (Peru), on individual-level job market outcomes. We rely on a difference-in-differences empirical strategy, based on comparing individuals who live close to the BRT system with a comparison group that lives farther from the system, before and after the system started to operate. We find large impacts on employment, hours worked and labor earnings for those individuals close to the BRT stations, but not for those who live close to the feeder lines. Despite the potential to connect poor populations, we find no evidence of impacts for populations living in lower income areas.","author":[{"family":"Scholl","given":"Lynn"},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Mitnik","given":"Oscar A."},{"family":"Oviedo","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Yañez-Paganz","given":"Patricia"}],"citation-key":"scholl2018","collection-title":"IDB Working Paper Series","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]},"language":"en-US","number":"980","page":"35","publisher":"Inter-American Development Bank","title":"A Rapid Road to Employment?

  {"id":"severen2018","abstract":"REVISED MARCH 2019 This paper studies the effects of Los Angeles Metro Rail on the spatial distribution of people and prices. Using a panel of bilateral commuting flows, I estimate a quantitative spatial general equilibrium model to quantify the welfare benefits of urban rail transit and distinguish the benefits of reduced commuting frictions from other channels. The subway causes a 7%-13% increase in commuting between pairs of connected tracts; I select plausible control pairs using proposed subway and historical streetcar lines to identify this effect. The structural parameters of the model are also estimated and are identified using a novel strategy that interacts tract-specific labor demand shocks with the spatial configuration of the city. These parameters indicate people are relatively unresponsive to changes in local prices and characteristics, implying that the commuting response corresponds to a large utility gain. The welfare benefits by 2000 are significant: LA Metro Rail increases aggregate welfare by $246 million annually. However, these benefits are only about one-third of annualized costs. While benefits did not outweigh costs by 2000, I employ more recent data to show that there are dynamic effects: Commuting continues to increase between connected locations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Severen","given":"Christopher"}],"citation-key":"severen2018","DOI":"10.21799/frbp.wp.2018.14","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,1]]},"language":"en","number":"3178460","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"Social Science Research Network","title":"Commuting, Labor, and Housing Market Effects of Mass Transportation: Welfare and Identification","title-short":"Commuting, Labor, and Housing Market Effects of Mass Transportation","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3178460"},

  {"id":"tomasiello2022","abstract":"Cumulative accessibility measures allow one to estimate the number of opportunities that can be reached within a given travel time threshold. They have become the most commonly used metric in transport research and planning because of how simple it makes to calculate and communicate accessibility results. However, cumulative opportunity measures require an ad-hoc choice of a single travel time threshold, which can importantly influence the conclusions of transport project evaluations and equity analyses. In this paper, we introduce the time interval cumulative accessibility measure, a new accessibility metric that mitigates the impacts of arbitrary choices of trip duration on cumulative accessibility analyses while keeping its computation and communicability advantages. The proposed indicator estimates the average or the median number of opportunities that can be reached considering multiple minute-by-minute travel time cutoffs within a given travel time interval. We demonstrate the new metric in a case study assessing how a planned subway expansion will likely impact employment accessibility in Fortaleza, Brazil. Using sensitivity analyses with Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the selection of travel time thresholds can substantially bias the results of accessibility levels and that such biases are not evenly distributed in space, having important implications for equity analyses. We also show that the proposed time interval cumulative opportunity metric makes the results of accessibility estimates and inequality analyses significantly less sensitive to ad-hoc methodological choices while yielding results that are very similar to those found with traditional threshold-based cumulative measures. Future accessibility-oriented transport research and planning could greatly benefit from the way in which the proposed time interval cumulative opportunity measure provides more robust accessibility estimates without compromising the communicability of results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Tomasiello","given":"Diego Bogado"},{"family":"Herszenhut","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"João Lucas Albuquerque"},{"family":"Braga","given":"Carlos Kaue Vieira"},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Rafael H.

  {"id":"tompa2021","abstract":"Purpose To develop a framework for estimating the economic benefits of an accessible and inclusive society and implement it for the Canadian context. The framework measures the gap between the current situation in terms of accessibility and inclusiveness, and a counterfactual scenario of a fully accessible and inclusive society. Design/methodology/approach The method consists of three steps. First, the conceptual framework was developed based on a literature review and expert knowledge. Second, the magnitudes for each domain of the framework was estimated for the reference year 2017 using data from various sources. Third, several sensitivity analyses were run using different assumptions and scenarios. Findings It was estimated that moving to a fully accessible and inclusive society would create a value of $337.7bn (with a range of $252.8–$422.7bn) for Canadian society in the reference year of 2017. This is a sizeable proportion of gross domestic product (17.6%, with a range of 13.1–22.0%) and is likely a conservative estimate of the potential benefits. Originality/value Understanding the magnitude of the economic benefits of an accessible and inclusive society can be extremely useful for governments, disability advocates and industry leaders as it provides invaluable information on the benefits of efforts, such as legislation, policies, programs and practices, to improve accessibility and inclusion of persons with disabilities. Furthermore, the total economic benefits and the benefits per person with a disability can serve as inputs in economic evaluations and impact assessments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Tompa","given":"Emile"},{"family":"Mofidi","given":"Amirabbas"},{"family":"Jetha","given":"Arif"},{"family":"Lahey","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Buettgen","given":"Alexis"}],"citation-key":"tompa2021","container-title":"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: An International Journal","DOI":"10.1108/EDI-07-2020-0186","ISSN":"2040-7149","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,1]]},"page":"318-339","publisher":"Emerald Publishing Limited","source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Development and implementation of a framework for estimating the economic benefits of an accessible and inclusive society","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/EDI-07-2020-0186","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"tyndall2017","abstract":"Expanding employment opportunities for citizens has become an increasingly central goal of public policy in the United States. Prior work has considered that the inability of households to spatially access jobs may be a driver of unemployment. The provision of public transportation provides a viable policy lever to increase the number of job opportunities available to households. Previous research has yielded mixed results regarding whether household location is an important factor in determining employment status. Several papers have identified mobility as a limiting factor for obtaining a job, particularly in regards to private vehicle ownership. The location of economically developed neighbourhoods and the citing of public transportation are conceivably codetermined, presenting an endogenous relationship. It is therefore unclear if public transportation access is actually contributing to neighbourhood job market outcomes. This paper will use the incidence of Hurricane Sandy striking New York City on 29 October 2012 and the resulting exogenous reduction in public transit access to particular neighbourhoods as a natural experiment to test for the effect of public transportation on employment outcomes. This study identifies a significant causal effect linking public transportation access to neighbourhood unemployment rates, particularly amongst subgroups dependent on public transit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tyndall","given":"Justin"}],"citation-key":"tyndall2017","container-title":"Urban Studies","container-title-short":"Urban Studies","DOI":"10.1177/0042098015594079","ISSN":"0042-0980, 1360-063X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2]]},"language":"en","page":"520-537","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Waiting for the R train: Public transportation and employment","title-short":"Waiting for the R train","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0042098015594079","volume":"54"},

  {"id":"wang2019","abstract":"Major cities in developing countries are undergoing massive transportation infrastructure construction, which has significant impacts on the land use and economic activities in these cities. Standard Cost–Benefit Analysis (CBA) is applied to quantify the user benefits of transport projects, but does not provide an answer as to who will obtain the benefits and who will lose out and excludes the calculation of Wider Economic Impacts (WEIs) which can sometimes be large and hardly negligible. This paper introduces thoughts and experiences obtained through the design and development of an integrated land use transport model for the assessment of the WEI of a transport infrastructure project. The development and application of such an integrated model for WEI analysis should help decision-makers understand not only the “direct or immediate” impact of transport infrastructure on mobility, but also those “indirect or long-term” impacts on the distribution patterns of economic activities, corresponding land use, and resulting urban structure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Wanle"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Hunt","given":"John Douglas"}],"citation-key":"wang2019","container-title":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su11020364","ISSN":"2071-1050","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"2","page":"364","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Analysis of the Wider Economic Impact of a Transport Infrastructure Project Using an Integrated Land Use Transport Model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/2/364","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"zhang2020","abstract":"We investigate the effects of metro systems on urban growth in China. Using a difference-in-differences combined with propensity score matching framework, we find that metro systems have an economically significant positive effect on the urban GDP growth rate and that this effect is much larger for megacities with permanent populations of more than 6.15 million. Meanwhile, cross-city metro operations tend to increase economic concentrations in larger cities and expand GDP inequalities between cities connected by a cross-city metro. Our mechanism analyses further corroborate that a higher metro density has a positive effect on urban employment growth and a negative effect on the average wage of employees, but this does not improve urban total factor productivity (TFP), suggesting that a metro system is more likely to provide consumption amenities and employment access than it is to provide production amenities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Haoran"}],"citation-key":"zhang2020","container-title":"Journal of Transport Geography","container-title-short":"Journal of Transport Geography","DOI":"10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2020.102732","ISSN":"0966-6923","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102732","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Metro and urban growth: Evidence from China","title-short":"Metro and urban growth","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692319306878","volume":"85"}
